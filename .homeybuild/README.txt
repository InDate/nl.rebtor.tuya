A implementation of [TuyAPI] (https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/) for Homey. 

This app connects localy with mains powered Tuya devices without making use of the Tuya cloud network and without the use of IFTT. 

Setup
For your convenience you can now fill in the API-key, API-secret and random deviceID on the settings page of the app, no need to fiddle with commandline anymore. 
See the setup instructions on https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/blob/master/docs/SETUP.md on how to uptain the API-key and API-secret and DeviceID. 

üìù Notes

-   Only one TCP connection can be in use with a device at once. If using this, do not have the app on your phone open.
