A implementation of [TuyAPI] (https://github.com/codetheweb/tuyapi/) for use with homey.

Basic Usage

See the setup instructions for how to find the needed parameters.

Once these parameters (ID and Key) are known you can use this information to create a device in homey to communicate with the Tuya cloud network without the use of IFTT.

Warning: This app is not plug and play finding the ID and Key needed tot communicate with the tuya cloud takes some doing.

üìù Notes

-   Only one TCP connection can be in use with a device at once. If using this, do not have the app on your phone open.
-   Some devices ship with older firmware that may not work with tuyapi. If you‚Äôre experiencing issues, please try updating the device‚Äôs firmware in the official app.
